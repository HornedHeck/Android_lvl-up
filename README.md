## Homework №1
Your task is to develop a simple dictionary from English to Russian. Briefly, you have ENRUS.TXT, there are English words and their Russian equivalents. A program should scan a word from console and print its translation until user enters "0". 


  Example:
  
  accountancy - > учет;
  
  humanize - > очеловечивать;
  
  strangeways - > странно;
  
  
You're welcome to add any additional functuanality, GUI and so on. Good luck =) 

## Homework №2
Are you ready to develop Android apps? It doesn't matter, cuz the first homework was just a ROFL =), but the second task's likely to be more complicated for you. Thus, you should develop Finger Fighting App. If your app is so amazing, we'll upload it to the Google Play. The main sense of the idea I'll tell you in a week. Have a nice day! =)

## Homework №3
The third Android project you should develop is connected with capturing and processing images. Don't be afraid of working with camera: it's really easy in Android (it concerns implicit intents, you'll learn it soon in our courses). So, your task is to develop app, that'll be able to take a photo (grab it from user's gallery - optionally) and return its negative version. If it doesn't impress you, add some additional functionality, that includes:
- Capability to adjust brightness of any photo
- Red, green and blue filters
- Cropping photos with animation of square area (for real nerds)

## Final projects
It's so pity, but our Android lvl-up courses is going to end. I'm sure, you have one or more projects you want to share in Google Play. If not, I'll give you the last chanсe to start your Android profile. Thus, I suggest to develop:
- TODO list for programmers, with the capability of connection to GitHub and retrieving TODO tasks from code
- Android File Manager, with awesome design, of course
- The third homework with all additional functionality
Hope, you'll cope with it.

Good luck =)
